STAGE 3 Task:

Write the prototype for tiny-cms project, finish the monorepo structure and each simplified package.
The reports under @reports/ are your reference for the architecture and design of the original Payload CMS, it also tells you briefly how to simplify them in tiny-cms. Further more, you MUST actually read the source code under @payload-main/ to understand the implementation details.

Rules:

- Reports and source code are only reference, you should write the prototype FROM SCRATCH as if it's a brand new project. DO NOT copy-paste any code and just remove some parts.
- DO NOT simply read all reports into your memory, make a plan, understand them one by one just like how you read source code.
